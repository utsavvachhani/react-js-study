# 11_todo-Context-Local

---

## 📖 Introduction

This project demonstrates a **React** application that uses **Context API** and **Local Storage** to create and manage a **To-Do List**. The app provides a seamless user experience for adding, deleting, and persisting tasks across sessions.

With the help of **Local Storage**, your tasks will not be lost even if you refresh or close the browser. The **Context API** ensures smooth state management across components without the need for prop drilling.
